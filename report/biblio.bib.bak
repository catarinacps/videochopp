  ab-stractnote = {CSML is a semantic markup language created for the publishing and
	sharing of conceptual spaces, which are geometric structures that
	represent semantics at the conceptual level. CSML can be used to
	describe semantics that are not captured well by the ontology languages
	commonly used in the Semantic Web. Measurement of the semantic similarity
	of concepts as well as the combination of concepts without shared
	properties are common human cognitive tasks. However, these operations
	present sources of difficulty for tools reliant upon set-theoretic
	and syllogistic reasoning on symbolic ontologies. In contrast, these
	operations can be modeled naturally using conceptual spaces. This
	paper describes the design decisions behind CSML, introduces the
	key component elements of a CSML document, and presents examples
	of its usage.},

  abstract = {We study the problem of detecting objects in still, gray-scale images. Our primary focus is the development of a learning-based approach to the problem that makes use of a sparse, part-based representation. A vocabulary of distinctive object parts is automatically constructed from a set of sample images of the object class of interest; images are then represented using parts from this vocabulary, together with spatial relations observed among the parts. Based on this representation, a learning algorithm is used to automatically learn to detect instances of the object class in new images. The approach can be applied to any object with distinguishable parts in a relatively fixed spatial configuration; it is evaluated here on difficult sets of real-world images containing side views of cars, and is seen to successfully detect objects in varying conditions amidst background clutter and mild occlusion. In evaluating object detection approaches, several important methodological issues arise that have not been satisfactorily addressed in the previous work. A secondary focus of this paper is to highlight these issues, and to develop rigorous evaluation standards for the object detection problem. A critical evaluation of our approach under the proposed standards is presented.},

  abstract = {Conceptual spaces have been proposed as a meso level representation, intermediate between symbolic and connectionist representations. We define a conceptual space to be a set of images or “voltage maps” on a compact sub plane, and equip it with pseudo-physiological notions of distance and betweenness. While our meso level representation is easily linked to higher and lower representations, we argue that its natural notion of geometry provides powerful additional tools for knowledge modelling and reasoning. As illustration, we offer an explanation of multi-dimensional experimental results which suggets distances follow different order Minkowski measures according to whether the dimentions are integral or separable.},
